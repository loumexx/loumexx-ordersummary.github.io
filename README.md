## My process

Initially, what I did first was I designed desktop-first, and then I got stuck. I looked through YouTube for a walkthrough and coded along with a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaM5F8O_VI8&t=649s) I referred to whenever I would get stuck. I pretty much did what the video did at first as well; structured the HTML, and then went to styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With the video that I have watched, I discovered CSS custom properties and that you should learn how to properly structure your HTML in order for your styling to be efficient and effective.

### Continued development

After this challenge, I think I should also do more exercises that involve Flexbox as it would also help me become more comfortable with CSS layouts. Once I start to learn JS, I'll start to do easy challenges that involve JS.
